		<p>Twenty five years experience with imaginative and forward-looking start-ups in three distinct industry verticals - each involving disruptive technologies and transformative business models.</p>
		<p>I guess that makes me a serial entrepreneur, however, I think of myself as </p>
		<p>"Simply crazy about improving business sectors that should work better and being surrounded by people who think the same way".</p>
		<p>Along the way I have started two companies and sold the software asset that came from those companies to GE and SingleStop USA respectively. In each case, we invented a new business process that changed the way others approached the industry. Our goal was to be either first or best, and we ended up doing both. That phrase has come to define how I approach business and the shortest description of how to create wealth - as being first or best is always a virtue. It has also served to guide my approach to building an organization. A good idea, pursued and executed by the best people, wins every time. That notion has never failed me.</p>
