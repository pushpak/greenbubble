	<p>Our mission is to find very low capital incentive algae growing facility. By partnering with a leading plastics industry, we have come up with a very low cost material which is durable, robust and sterile. By taking this material and using some ingenious engineering we created GrowPods. These are easily assembled tanks that you can be placed on the terrace or in the backyard. They can be used to grow fish, grow plants, grow algae, Grow Lotus, Grow lawns and anything you want.</p>
